    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        The Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating is a delicious and unique dish that combines the rich flavors of wild-caught Alaska salmon with the crispy, nutty texture of a pecan-based crust. The salmon, known for its firm texture and natural, slightly sweet taste, is first coated with a mixture of crushed pecans, breadcrumbs, and seasonings, which is then baked to perfection. The result is a golden-brown, crispy exterior with a tender and juicy salmon interior.

        This dish highlights the delicate balance between the savory, mild taste of the salmon and the rich, slightly sweet crunch of the pecans, making it a flavorful and satisfying meal.

Often paired with a side of vegetables or a light salad, the Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating offers a healthy yet indulgent option, ideal for seafood lovers or anyone seeking a gourmet twist on a classic fish dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>4 Alaska salmon fillets (skin-on or skinless, depending on preference)</li>
        <li>1 cup pecans, finely chopped or crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs (preferably panko for a lighter, crunchier texture)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil (or melted butter, for brushing)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving, optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pecan Coating:</strong> In a shallow bowl or plate, combine the finely chopped pecans, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan (if using), garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Salmon:</strong> Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel. Brush each fillet with a thin layer of olive oil (or melted butter) to help the coating adhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Salmon:</strong> Press each salmon fillet, flesh-side down, into the pecan mixture, gently pressing so that the coating sticks. Make sure the top of each fillet is evenly coated with the pecan mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the coated salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the pecan crust is golden and crispy. The internal temperature of the salmon should reach 145째F (63째C).</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven and let the salmon rest for a couple of minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley (optional) and serve with lemon wedges for extra brightness.</li>
    </ol>
