    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Summer Sweet Smoothies are the perfect refreshing treat for hot days, offering a blend of vibrant, seasonal fruits and other wholesome ingredients. These smoothies are all about celebrating the flavors of summer, with fruits like juicy peaches, ripe strawberries, sweet mangoes, and tangy pineapples taking center stage. Often, these fruits are blended with a base of yogurt, coconut water, or almond milk to create a creamy, hydrating texture that's as satisfying as it is nourishing.

    <p>
        The beauty of summer sweet smoothies lies in their versatility. You can mix and match your favorite fruits to create endless combinations, adding in extras like fresh mint, a squeeze of citrus, or even a handful of leafy greens like spinach or kale for an extra nutritional boost. To enhance the sweetness, honey, agave syrup, or a splash of vanilla extract can be added, creating a smooth, balanced flavor profile.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 cup frozen or fresh mixed fruit (such as strawberries, mango, pineapple, blueberries, or peaches)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Greek yogurt (or dairy-free yogurt for a vegan option)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 cup liquid base (coconut water, almond milk, or regular milk)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey or agave syrup (optional, for extra sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>A handful of spinach or kale (optional, for added nutrition)</li>
        <li>Ice cubes (optional, if using fresh fruit or for a colder, slushy texture)</li>
        <li>1/2 banana (optional, for extra creaminess)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chia seeds or flax seeds (optional, for added fiber and nutrients)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> If you're using fresh fruit, wash and chop it into smaller pieces. For frozen fruit, there's no need to chop.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the Smoothie:</strong> Add your fruit (about 1 cup), yogurt (1/2 cup), and liquid (1/2 to 1 cup) to a blender. If you like a sweeter smoothie, add honey or agave syrup, and for extra flavor, a splash of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Add-ins:</strong> For extra nutrition, you can add a handful of spinach or kale, chia seeds, flax seeds, or a banana for creaminess. You can also add a few ice cubes if you're using fresh fruit and want a colder smoothie.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend Until Smooth:</strong> Blend on high until smooth and creamy. If the smoothie is too thick, add more liquid to reach your desired consistency. If it's too thin, add more frozen fruit or ice cubes.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong> Taste the smoothie and adjust the sweetness if necessary by adding more honey/agave or a bit more fruit. Blend again if you made any adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Pour into a glass and serve immediately. You can garnish with extra fruit, a sprinkle of chia seeds, or even a mint sprig for an extra touch.</li>
    </ol>
