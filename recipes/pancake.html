    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are a delightful twist on the classic pancake, offering a light and fluffy texture with a refreshing, zesty flavor. These pancakes are made with a blend of ricotta cheese, eggs, flour, and a touch of lemon zest, creating a batter that is rich yet airy. The ricotta cheese contributes to a soft, moist interior, while the lemon zest imparts a bright, citrusy note that balances the richness of the cheese.

    <p>
        When cooked, the pancakes form a golden-brown exterior, and when you cut into them, they reveal a tender, melt-in-your-mouth interior. The combination of creamy ricotta and tangy lemon creates a delicate flavor profile that is both indulgent and refreshing.
