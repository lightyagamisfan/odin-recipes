    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are a delightful twist on the classic pancake, offering a light and fluffy texture with a refreshing, zesty flavor. These pancakes are made with a blend of ricotta cheese, eggs, flour, and a touch of lemon zest, creating a batter that is rich yet airy. The ricotta cheese contributes to a soft, moist interior, while the lemon zest imparts a bright, citrusy note that balances the richness of the cheese.

        When cooked, the pancakes form a golden-brown exterior, and when you cut into them, they reveal a tender, melt-in-your-mouth interior. The combination of creamy ricotta and tangy lemon creates a delicate flavor profile that is both indulgent and refreshing.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar (optional, depending on desired sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (whole milk or any milk substitute like almond or oat milk)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lemon zest (from about 1 lemon)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Butter or oil (for greasing the pan)</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar (for dusting, optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh berries (blueberries, strawberries, etc. for serving, optional)</li>
        <li>Maple syrup or honey (for serving, optional)</li>
        <li>Whipped cream (optional, for serving)</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese, eggs, sugar (if using), milk, lemon zest, and lemon juice until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Dry to Wet:</strong> Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmixâ€”the batter should be slightly lumpy and thick. If it's too thick, add a splash more milk to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil. Once the pan is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges look set. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Serve with fresh berries, maple syrup, a dusting of powdered sugar, and a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</li>
    </ol>
